### SCRIPTS:

> Below I put the explanation and images of some scripts. **CLICK TO EXPAND**

<details>

<summary>ðŸ—— default.sh</summary>

## _ðŸ™¼ default.sh_

This is a script I created to be used within all other shell scripts. This is useful to stylize texts, and to create menus quickly. To use this, import default.sh at the beginning of your script code:

```bash
source "default.sh"
```

**Examples and Features:**

**ðŸ”¸ TEXT STYLIZER FEATURE**

```bash
# WITHOUT DEFAULT.SH
echo -ne "\e[1m\e[97m SCRIPT NAME \e[2m\e[37m\e[7m teste.sh \e[0m"
echo -e "\e[34m I'm blue,\e[31m I'm red,\e[32m I'm green."
echo -e "\e[42m\e[1m\e[97m Bold White Text on Green Background "
```

```bash
# WITH DAFAULT.SH
title "SCRIPT NAME"
echo -e "$blue I'm blue,$red I'm red,$green I'm green."
echo -e "$bg_green$bold$white Bold White Text on Green Background "
```

_Both examples print exactly the same result_

**ðŸ”¸ MENU CREATOR FEATURE**

FUNCTION MENU (fmenu) - Create menus from functions. To do this, simply create functions ending with "/menu":

```bash
The_menu_item/menu() {
  #commands
}
Another_item/menu() {
  #commands
}
fmenu
```

```txt
# RESULT:
 1. The menu item
 2. Another item

 NÂº
```

LIST MENU (lmenu) - Create menus from lists, arrays, files... To do this, just set the list parameter and the action:

```bash
action() {                                  # actions function
  echo "Your choice was: ${list[choice]}"   # the action
}
lmenu "$(ls /sys/class/net)"                # the list
```

```txt
# RESULT: In this example, your network interfaces will be listed as a menu.
 1. enp0s25
 2. lo
 3. virbr0
 4. virbr0-nic
 5. wlp0s26u1u2
 6. wlp3s0

 NÂº
```

LIST AND FUNTION MENUS **2** (fmenu2 and lmenu2) - These do the same things as the previous ones, but have keyboard support.

```text
â‡© down:             next item
â‡§ up:               previous item
â‡¨ right or space:   choose the option
â‡¦ left or q:        quit
```

You can get the main feed from your GitHub, to do this go to the homepage and copy the link where it says "Subscribe to your news feed". And put it in your configuration file:

```text
